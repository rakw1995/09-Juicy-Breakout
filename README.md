# 09-Juicy-Breakout
This repository is exactly what it sounds like. It's breakout, but JUICIER.

The objective of breakout is to score points using a paddle to direct a ball towards different colored tiles. 
Each color is worth a different number of points. 

Here's the juice, and how I juiced it:
* added music, found at https://opengameart.org/content/a-lucid-dream
    - I did this by adding a child node to the scene as an audio stream player.
* added some fun fonts, found at http://dafont.com 
    - I imported new font data and used custom fonts for the "label" text.
* game over music, found at https://opengameart.org/content/music-box-game-over-iii
    - See above for details.
* collision sound effects, found on opengameart.org
* particles!
